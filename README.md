Tripleten Sprint 4 Software Development Tools Project

In this project I am practicing how to create tools that simulate random events and the methods and libraries used to implement it.  In this project I have used the used car sales directory and I have tried to make different graphs and plots on the web app that would help someone be able to narrow down and search for available cars within their price range with varying factors including condition, type of car, model and how old it is. 

To launch this app on your local computer you should download or clone this repository (https://github.com/lizmonsen21/SoftwareDevelopmentProject.git).  Then when you have this repository on your local machine, you can go into your preferred command line and run the command: streamlit run app.py.
